The project allowed me to learn how to read the content of a file from a file descriptor using static variables. This function retrieves a single line from a specified file descriptor. When called in a loop, get_next_line returns all the contents of the file, one line at a time until the end of the file is reached. Additionally, this function can be compiled with any buffer size specified.

In the Development folder you can find my progress: the code I wrote to understand the core concepts of the project.
